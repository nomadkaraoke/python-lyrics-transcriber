# Lyrics Transcriber Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature MUST follow strict TDD methodology: write failing tests first, then implement minimal code to make tests pass, then refactor for quality. All tests MUST be written before any implementation code. Contract tests are required for all API endpoints, integration tests for all user workflows, and unit tests for all complex business logic. Code coverage MUST maintain minimum 90% line coverage for new code, with no decrease in overall project coverage allowed.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures predictable behavior, reduces bugs, enables safe refactoring, and serves as living documentation. The complex audio/video processing pipeline requires rigorous testing to prevent regressions.

### II. Code Quality & Maintainability
All code MUST be self-documenting through clear naming, comprehensive docstrings for public APIs, and adherence to established patterns. Type hints are mandatory for all function signatures and complex data structures. Code MUST pass linting (flake8/black), static type checking (mypy), and security scanning. No code duplication above 15 lines without explicit architectural justification. All public functions MUST include comprehensive docstrings with examples.

**Rationale**: High-quality, maintainable code reduces technical debt, enables team collaboration, and ensures the complex multimedia processing pipeline remains debuggable and extensible.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces (CLI, web UI, API responses) MUST provide consistent interaction patterns, error messaging, and feedback mechanisms. CLI commands MUST follow standard Unix conventions with consistent flag naming and help text. Web UI MUST maintain responsive design, accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA), and consistent visual patterns. All error messages MUST be actionable with clear next steps for users.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces user cognitive load, improves adoption, and reduces support burden. The tool serves both technical and non-technical users requiring intuitive interfaces.

### IV. Performance & Reliability
All audio/video processing operations MUST complete within defined performance budgets (see Performance Standards below). Memory usage MUST remain bounded with proper cleanup of large media objects. All external API calls MUST implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns. System MUST gracefully handle and recover from failures without data loss.

**Rationale**: Media processing is resource-intensive and time-critical. Users expect reliable, efficient processing of their audio files without system crashes or excessive wait times.

### V. Observability & Monitoring
All operations MUST emit structured logs with consistent formatting and appropriate log levels. Performance metrics MUST be collected for all critical paths (transcription time, correction accuracy, API response times). All external service interactions MUST be instrumented with tracing. System health checks MUST be implemented for all services and dependencies.

**Rationale**: Complex AI/ML pipelines require comprehensive observability to diagnose issues, optimize performance, and ensure system reliability in production environments.

## Performance Standards

**Processing Time Limits**:
- Audio transcription: <30 seconds per minute of audio (excluding external API wait time)  
- Lyrics correction: <10 seconds per song
- Video generation: <2x real-time (e.g., 4 minutes for 2-minute song)
- Web UI response: <200ms for interactive operations, <2 seconds for processing operations

**Resource Constraints**:
- Memory usage: <4GB peak for processing single audio files up to 10 minutes
- Disk usage: Temporary files MUST be cleaned up within 24 hours
- CPU usage: MUST support concurrent processing of up to 3 songs simultaneously

**Reliability Requirements**:
- External API failures MUST NOT crash the application
- Processing MUST resume from checkpoint after interruption for operations >30 seconds
- Data corruption detection and recovery MUST be implemented for all cache operations

## Development Workflow

**Pre-Development Gates**:
- All features MUST have approved specification before development begins
- Technical design MUST be reviewed and approved for features touching core processing pipeline
- Breaking changes MUST have migration plan and backward compatibility period

**Code Review Requirements**:
- All code MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Performance-critical changes MUST include performance test results
- Security-sensitive changes MUST include security review
- UI changes MUST include accessibility review and cross-browser testing

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests MUST pass before merge
- Code coverage MUST NOT decrease from current levels
- Static analysis MUST pass without warnings for new code
- Performance benchmarks MUST NOT regress by >5% without justification

## Governance

**Amendment Process**:
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards. Amendments require:
1. Written proposal with justification and impact analysis
2. Review by project maintainers
3. Migration plan for existing code if applicable
4. Update of all dependent templates and documentation

**Compliance Review**:
- All pull requests MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles
- Monthly review of adherence to performance standards and quality metrics
- Quarterly review of constitution effectiveness and potential amendments

**Exception Process**:
Temporary exceptions to principles may be granted for critical fixes or urgent features, but MUST:
1. Be explicitly documented with expiration date
2. Include plan for bringing code into compliance
3. Be approved by project maintainer
4. Be tracked until resolved

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-29 | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-29
