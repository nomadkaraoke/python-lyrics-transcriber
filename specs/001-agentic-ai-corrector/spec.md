# Feature Specification: Agentic AI Corrector

**Feature Branch**: `001-agentic-ai-corrector`  
**Created**: September 29, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Agentic AI Corrector: this lyrics-transcriber project (see @README.md for context) works well, but there is still almost always enough transcription errors to require at least 5-10 minutes of human time spent using the lyrics transcription review web UI to identify and correct the mistakes, as the approaches I've implemented so far to try and correct the lyrics (see @corrector.py ) are far from perfect, and sometimes make things better, sometimes worse.

I'd like to try and see if we can improve the performance of lyrics-transcriber dramatically by implementing an agentic AI to do the lyrics correction process, replacing my existing correction handlers.
the human review process should still exist and be launched after the automated agentic AI correction is finished. we should record any corrections which are made by humans in the review process (including potentially getting the human to tag the reason for each correction to give us richer data). then, hopefully we can use that human feedback to feed back into the AI correction process so it gets smarter and more accurate the more human feedback it gets. (I'm not sure if this is actually Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) but hopefully you get the idea, whatever makes most sense I just want to make the most of the human time spent making corrections, to learn from the human input).

As part of this process, I'd also like to use this as an opportunity to learn about agentic AI and use modern (as of September 2025) best practices, tools and approaches. for example, I've heard a lot about langchain and langgraph, and I'd like to set up observability instrumentation with langfuse to help make sure we can understand what's going on as things are running. If there's a sensible and generally encouraged way to implement tests, or a recommended testing framework, let's set that up too and create any tests which are a good idea."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a lyrics transcriber user, I want the system to automatically correct transcription errors with high accuracy so that I spend significantly less time (ideally under 2 minutes instead of 5-10 minutes) manually reviewing and fixing lyrics alignment issues, while still maintaining quality control through human oversight.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a transcribed audio file with typical errors (wrong words, extra words), **When** the agentic AI corrector processes it, **Then** the majority of errors are automatically identified and corrected before human review
2. **Given** AI-corrected lyrics in the review interface, **When** a human reviewer makes corrections, **Then** the system captures both the corrections and the reasoning behind them for future learning
3. **Given** accumulated human feedback over multiple correction sessions, **When** the AI processes similar error patterns in future transcriptions, **Then** the AI demonstrates improved accuracy on those error types
4. **Given** system operators monitoring the correction process, **When** they access observability dashboards, **Then** they can track AI performance, error patterns, and improvement over time
5. **Given** edge cases or complex corrections that challenge the AI, **When** human reviewers provide detailed feedback, **Then** this feedback is systematically incorporated to improve future AI performance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the AI agent produces corrections that are worse than the original transcription?
- How does the system handle cases where human reviewers disagree with AI suggestions?
- What happens when the AI agent encounters completely new types of errors not seen in training data?
- How does the system maintain performance when processing languages or music genres not well represented in feedback data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST replace the existing rule-based correction handlers with an agentic AI system that can analyze transcription errors and propose corrections
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain the existing human review workflow, launching the review interface after AI correction is complete
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture all human corrections made during the review process, including both the correction itself and metadata about the change
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a mechanism for human reviewers to tag or categorize the reasons for each correction they make
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement a feedback loop where human corrections improve the AI's future performance on similar error patterns
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide comprehensive observability and monitoring of the AI correction process, including performance metrics and error analysis
- **FR-007**: System MUST achieve a minimum 70% reduction in errors requiring human correction compared to the existing correction system
- **FR-008**: System MUST reduce human review time proportionally based on song complexity, with simple songs requiring minimal review and complex songs requiring proportionally less time than the current 5-10 minutes
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle the same variety of transcription errors that the current system processes (word misrecognition, extra words, etc.)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide fallback behavior when the AI system is unavailable or fails by automatically reverting to the existing rule-based correction handlers to ensure uninterrupted processing
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing output formats (ASS, LRC, CDG, video) without requiring changes to downstream processes
- **FR-012**: System MUST include comprehensive testing capabilities for both AI correction accuracy and the learning feedback loop
